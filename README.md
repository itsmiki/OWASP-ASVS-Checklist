# OWASP ASVS Checklist
Checklist for OWASP ASVS 5.0.0 audits

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository contains a checklist based on the **OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS) version 5.0.0**. The goal of this project is to facilitate security audits and streamline the process of verifying applications against the ASVS standard. The spreadsheet format allows for easy tracking of compliance status, note-taking during assessments, and reporting.

## 📖 Overview of the Checklist
The `STATISTICS` sheet serves as the main dashboard. It provides a comprehensive summary of the checklist, visualizes assessment results with graphs, and offers essential configuration options.

You can customize the audit scope by selecting the target ASVS levels in the settings. Checks associated with deselected levels are automatically excluded from the summary metrics and graphs. Additionally, these out-of-scope checks are visually struck through in their respective sheets for clarity.
